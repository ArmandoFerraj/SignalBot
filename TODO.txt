TODO:

- finish the process_message() function in helper.py
	- this function will be used in sever.py. It takes the incoming message POSTED to the server as input.
	- we need to parse this message and turn it into a dictionary that our trading bot can use: {symbol:'Shitcoin', enter_price:1.20, exit_price:1.26}

- need to implement the coinbase functions into the state machine
	- the enter_positon() method in FSM class needs to be able to connect to coinbase and buy stuff
	- the exit_position() method in FSM class needs to be able to connect to coinbase and sell stuff

- need to add exit strategy logic
	- in the run() method in FSM class we need to input the exit strategy logic inside of the if statement "if self.state = sell"
	- this logic determines WHEN to use the exit_position() method
